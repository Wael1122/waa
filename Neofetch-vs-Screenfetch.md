The goal of this wiki page is to answer the questions:

- How is Neofetch different from Screenfetch?
- What's wrong with Screenfetch?

## History of Neofetch

I first started writing Neofetch or as it was originally called "fetch" back in November of 2015. I was just getting started with shell scripting at this point so I was writing scripts for anything and everything I could think of. I had the idea of showing an image next to system info and decided to turn it into a working script.

The screenshot below is the oldest screenshot I have of `fetch`. This version
